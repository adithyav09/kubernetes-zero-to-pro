# **Kubernetes** - ***Section 4:*** `Observability`

<br />

`Observability` is the ability to *understand the current **state of a system***, and how that **state** came to be. `Observability` is achieved by *collecting and analyzing **data from the system***. This data is then *used to make informed **decisions about the system***.

<br />

`Observability` is a ***key*** part `Kubernetes`.  It is ***critical*** to ***monitor*** and ***manage*** the ***health*** of your `Kubernetes` cluster.  `Kubernetes` provides ***several*** tools to help you ***monitor*** and ***manage*** your cluster.

<br />

**Tools** for `Observability`:

* `readiness` and `liveness` probes
* container `logging`
* `metrics-server`  

<br />
