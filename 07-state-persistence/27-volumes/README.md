# <img src="../../00-resources/img/k8s.png" width="30px"> **Kubernetes** - ***Volumes*** 💾


## **Description** 👀

`Docker containers` are meant to be **transient** in nature. They are meant to be **created**, **used**, and then **destroyed**. This is a great feature of `containers`, but it also presents a problem when it comes to *state persistence*. Just like in `Docker` the `pods` in `Kubernetes` are also transient. This means that if a pod is destroyed, all of its ***data is lost***. This is a problem if you want to *store data* in a `pod`. To persist data in a `pod` you can use `volumes`. `Volumes` are a way to *store data* in a `pod` that will persist even if the `pod` is destroyed. `Volumes` are also a way to *share data* between `pods`.

## **Examples** 🧩

* `pod` definition with a `volume`

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Pod
    metadata:
        name: my-pod
    spec: 
        containers:
          - name: alpine
            image: alpine
            command: ["/bin/sh", "-c"]
            args: ["shuf -i 0-100 -n >> /opt/number.out"]
            volumeMounts:
              - mountPath: /opt
                name: data-volume
        volumes:
          - name: data-volume
            hostPath:
                path: /data
                type: Directory
    ```
